This project was required by the examination board as part of my qualification in A-Level Computer Science. This equated to 20% of the total grade.

The aim of the project was to create a website platform where users could easily view and compare the market share of different organisations within the same industry. The goal was to provide a simple and efficient way for users to understand their own market positions and make data-driven decisions. By collecting and visualizing data from various companies, this platform would reduce the cost and time associated with market research.




## Environments Used

I've used the following environments to develop the website

`VISUAL STUDIO CODE`    `DB BROWSER`    `MICROSOFT EXCEL`
`SQLITE` `XAMPP SERVER` `MAMP SERVER`


## Features

- **Navigation Header Menu**: An intuitive navigation menu that allows users to easily access different sections of the website.

- **Registration System**: A user registration system that enables users to create accounts with their credentials.

- **Login System**: User authentication system for registered users to log in securely.

- **User Input for Revenue**: Functionality for users to input and submit revenue data for their company or industry.

- **Industry Glossary List**: An industry glossary that users can access, and it scrolls down to the relevant term when clicked on a letter at the top.

- **Search Function**: A search feature to help users quickly find specific companies, data, or terms within the platform.

- **Data Validation**: Implement data validation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of user-submitted information.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the platform is responsive and works on various devices and screen sizes.

- **Security**: Implement security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

- **Data Visualization**: Interactive and visually appealing data visualizations to make it easy for users to



## Run Locally - Installation

(1) Go to the following repository
```bash
  https://github.com/deffonotfari/NEAProject
```
(2) Downloadd all files

(3) Click on the HTML file to run the website


## Testing

The platform has undergone rigorous testing to ensure its functionality, security, and reliability. I have conducted the following types of testing:

- **Acceptance Testing**: Comprehensive acceptance testing has been performed to verify that the platform meets the specified requirements and is ready for use by end-users. This includes validating that it fulfills the primary goal of providing market share insights efficiently.

- **Iterative Testing**: My testing approach has been iterative, allowing me to continuously refine and improve the platform with each iteration. This iterative process ensures that the platform evolves to meet changing user needs and industry standards.

- **White Box Testing**: White box testing has been conducted to assess the internal logic, code quality, and security of the platform. This type of testing allows me to identify and rectify any vulnerabilities or issues within the codebase.

I've carried out this testing using my local computer and asking the users to use their own devices to test the website. I have not hosted it on the internet yet as the data used is not completely accurate
